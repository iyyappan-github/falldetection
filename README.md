the goal of this project is to address the issue of elderly individuals and patients falling or
slipping, which can result in serious bone and muscle injuries. As they age, their bodies get
softer and more fragile resulting in fall. We are planning to develop a jacket which inflates
when fall happens, so we can prevent serious injuries of car and bike racing and test drivers.
We can also use this in orthopaedic patients as they need serious care at the beginning. Since
it aids in the perception of fall, the concepts of this study can also be applied in biomedical
fields. So, we detect the fall using gyroscope sensor-MTG6050 and using Nodemcu we tune
that sensor to detect the precise fall. Afterall the tuning we generate a alert message and sent
to the medical care team or the nearest person to the patient. We initially planning to simulate
the model and finally develop it as a product for market.
